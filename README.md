## Condition if - else
  <br>
  
***The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a
given condition. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the
condition is false, the else block code is executed.***

## Condition Ternary Operator
<br>

***An alternative to the if/else statement, the ternary operator allows JavaScript
developers to write concise conditional statements. It is written as “?:” and takes
three operands; a logical condition, a value to return if true, and a value to return if
false.***

![switch](https://pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JavaScript-switch-statements-Thumbnail-NoWM.png)
## Condition Switch case
<br>

***The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value
against a series of case clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause
with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of
a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value***

## Loop for
  <br>
  
***The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, 
enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons. It is followed by a statement 
(usually a block statement) that is executed repeatedly within the loop.***

![while](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jQEiQDcdtLzq1bn3mbNWwg.png)
## Loop while
<br>

***The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as
the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the
statement. The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three.***

![do-while](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR2ldbXOusP24qPZlYZU4nObdKBUn7yMR-UXA&s)
## Loop do-while
<br>

***The condition is evaluated after executing the
statement, resulting in the specified statement
executing at least once. In the following example,
the do...while loop iterates at least once and
reiterates until i is no longer less than 5.***
